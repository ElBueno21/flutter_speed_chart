    ]

SpeedLineChart(
    lineSeriesCollection: _lineSeriesCollection0,
    title: _lineSeriesCollection0[0].name,
    showLegend: false,
),
```

create a multiple line chart

```dart

List<LineSeries> lineSeriesCollection1 = [
    _getChartData(
        data: [
            {"time": "2022-09-16 00:41:38", "value": "12.0"},
            {"time": "2022-09-16 00:51:39", "value": "23.0"},

        ],
        color: Colors.red,
        name: 'Line0',
        ),
    _getChartData(
        data: [
            {"time": "2022-09-16 00:41:38", "value": "12.0"},
            {"time": "2022-09-16 00:51:39", "value": "23.0"},

        color: Colors.red,
        name: 'Line0',
        ),
    ]

SpeedLineChart(
    lineSeriesCollection: _lineSeriesCollection1,
    title: _lineSeriesCollection0[0].name,
    showLegend: false,
),
